(1) Installation

GraphCore requires NetworkML which cannot be installed from PyPI.
You need to install from GitHub by:
  pip install git+https://github.com/myngshj3/networkml
or
  git clone https://github.com/myngshj3/networkml
  cd networkml
  pip install -e .

Then, install GraphCore.
You need to install from GitHub by:
  pip install git+https://github.com/myngshj3/graphcore
or
  git clone https://github.com/myngshj3/graphcore
  cd graphcore
  pip install -e .


(2) Configuration

GraphCore requires configuration file 'graphcore.cfg' in the directory
GRAPHCORE_HOME environment variable indicates.
You need to set GRAPHCORE_HOME environment variable adequate directory
like below:
  GRAPHCORE_HOME=`pwd`    (if bash or its family)
  or
  set GRAPHCORE_HOME variable on 'Environment Variable' dialog (if win)

Configuration file `graphcore.cfg' is downloadable from GitHub repository
like below:
  git clone https://github.com/myngshj3/graphcore-examples

This directory contains `basic-flow' directory and `basic-flow/graphcore.cfg`
configuration file. You can set this directory to GRAPHCORE_HOME.

(3) Start GraphCore application

You can get started GraphCore easily by typing like below:
  graphcore
if configuration is adequate.


(4) GraphCore model file conversion

You might have latest version of GraphCore application if you cannot
deal with your own model file, since latest version of GraphCore model
file format is different from past versions.
If then, you need to convert by `gcconvert' command like below:
  gcconvert <old-version-model-file> <output-model-file>


Good Luck !
